You can also create new cooks and clients to test functionality. Notifcations were implemented as well, however it is hard to test notifactions on a single device because
they will be sent to the logged in User so when an update is made you will not recieve it on your account thats logged in. Please refer to our services folder that contains
our Firebase Cloud Messaging implementation (FirebaseMessagingService.java).
