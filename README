from the inbox fragment and they will be stored in the database and appear dynamically for the Admin. 

For testing Cooks meal managment system, create an account as a Cook, in the profile fragment (the profile icon in the nav bar), there will be a manage menu button.
Any registered cook can make changes to their menu and they are stored in the database accordingly.
